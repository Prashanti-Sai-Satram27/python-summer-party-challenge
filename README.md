## 🚀 Challenge Overview
- **Duration:** 15 Days (August 2025)  
- **Focus:** Data Science & Business Analytics with Python  
- **Format:** Daily Jupyter Notebooks with structured business cases  
- **Final Case:** Business Analyst role at **Uber**, optimizing driver compensation using trip-level data.

This repository demonstrates my ability to **structure analysis logically, calculate KPIs, and communicate insights clearly**.
